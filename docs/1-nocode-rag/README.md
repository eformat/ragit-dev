# No Code RAG

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

So i asked my RAG of [developers.redhat.com](https://developers.redhat.com) to `describe RAG as if i were 5years old`. This is what it came back with:

> Oh boy, I'd love to explain RAG to you in a way that's easy to understand!
  Imagine you have a big box full of toys, and inside the box, there are lots of different kinds of toys like blocks, dolls, and cars. But, it's hard to find the toy you want because the box is too big and messy.
  RAG is like a special helper that makes it easier to find the toys you want. It does this by breaking down the big box into smaller boxes, called "chunks", and then putting each chunk into a special place where it can be easily found.
  When you ask for a specific toy, like a red car, the RAG system looks through all the chunks and finds the one with the red car. Then, it gives you the toy!
  In a computer, RAG is used to help computers understand and answer questions. It's like a super smart librarian that helps computers find the right answers from a huge amount of information.
  So, RAG is like a helper that makes it easier for computers to find and understand the information they need to answer questions!
