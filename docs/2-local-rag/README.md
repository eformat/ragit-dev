# Local RAG

(OPTIONAL)

The idea here is to allow a local loop experience. Try out some of these !

- [Podman Desktop (easier)](2-local-rag/1-podman-desktop.md)
- [Local RAG with langchain for developers (harder)](2-local-rag/1-local-rag-langchain.md)
- [Local RAG with lamaindex for developers (harder)](2-local-rag/1-local-rag-llamaindex.md)

In the next section [Simple Rag](3-simple-rag/README.md) - we get this code onto a RHOAI cluster!
